This is the code repository for data dimensionality reduction and clustering in this study. It includes self-organizing mapping and K-means clustering. Firstly, perform simple preprocessing on the data, and then feed it into the SOM network for training. The trained results will be clustered based on K-means. Finally, a clustering distribution graph based on SOM two-dimensional topological structure will be obtained. The following is the result graph based on SOM and k-means training.
